				This site was created for my robotics team. We use it while at competitions to
				collect data on others team for when teams are selected. Users can scout matches,
				scout team pits and submit images, browse submitted form, bet on matches at the
				competition, and view their scouting schedule. To complement this site, I also made
				a discord bot with Node.js to remind people when they are scouting, which is also in
				the repository. It uses Next.js API Routes for the backend and MongoDB for the
				database, which the bot also draws upon as a data source.

				the ability to convert images to amoguses to every device that can run a browser. I
				learned a lot about browser APIs and pushed what I thought I could do in a browser
				to its limits. This is by far the project I am most proud of, and I consider it my
				magnum opus. Above is an example of a result of using the converter.

				Sadly, I cannot share pictures or the source code for this application because I

				truck brokerage, I was paid for it, but still own the source code, and it is my
				second largest application after Yeti Scouting. Brokerages basically connect
				truckers with people who are looking to have something moved. This app helps keeps
				track of customers, truckers, loads, and employee progress on closing loads. I
				deployed the frontend, backend, and database on AWS using Docker and used Nginx to
				have both servers running in one container.

				This project may forever lay unfinished, but I'm proud of what I did before I had to

				making full blown apps for it and you can see the beginnings of those plans on the
				site. You can open windows, resize windows, minimize windows, fullscreen windows,
				and close windows. Custom hooks and the context API are used to handle state between
				windows and provides for an authentic experience.

				This project was one of my first projects and introduced me to Styled Components. It

				using MDX and Gatsby's graphql api, and has a custom image slideshow on the home
				page. I'm quite proud of this site and I learned a lot about css, animation,
				responsive design, and statically generating content while making it.

				Java JS is a collection of implementations of JavaScript APIs in Java. Right now

				AbstractList, meaning it has all of the method you would expect a list to have in
				Java. I also use this repository to test my Java formatting solution using prettier
				which I would like to add to my robotics team's repositories.
