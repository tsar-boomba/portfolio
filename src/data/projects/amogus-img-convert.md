First of all, I would like to dedicate this site to my good friend, [Hank Magan](https://github.com/hmagan), who inspired me to make this after I saw his success in python. I wanted to bring the ability to convert images to amoguses to every device that can run a browser.

- Uses input and Blob browser apis
- Pixel manipulation on raw image buffers
- Encodes final image into GIF format for downloading
